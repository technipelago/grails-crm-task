== Introduction

{gr8crm} is a set of http://www.grails.org/[Grails Web Application Framework]
plugins that makes it easy to develop web applications with CRM functionality.

You can find more information about {gr8crm} on the main documentation site {homepage}.

=== Customer Relationship Management

Customer relationship management (CRM) is a system for managing a company’s interactions with current and future customers.
It involves using technology to organize, automate and synchronize sales, marketing, customer service, and technical support.
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Customer_relationship_management[Wikipedia]

The {gr8crm} "Ecosystem" currently contains over 40 Grails plugins. For a complete list of plugins see {homepage}.

Each {gr8crm} plugin defines a http://martinfowler.com/bliki/BoundedContext.html[Bounded Context]
that focus on one specific domain, for example *contact*, *project* or *document*.

== Task Management Plugin

A *Task* in {gr8crm} is a domain instance that represents a unit of work that has been done in the past or is scheduled to be done in the future.
A task is very similar to a calendar item, it has a start time and a duration.
Because tasks are so generic and flexible, {gr8crm} applications can use tasks in many ways. Here's are a list of real-world use-cases for tasks.

- Calendar items
- Scheduled meetings, with list of attenders
- Conference or training registration
- Telemarketing call items
- Alarms on important dates
- Time reporting
- Event logging

== Domain Model

In the center of the domain model is the +CrmTask+ domain class. It has a reference to +CrmTaskType+ that specifies
what type of task it is (phone call, meeting, training, work item, etc.)
A task also has a many-relation to +CrmTaskAttender+. This collection is used when you want to specify attenders on the task.
The +CrmTaskAttender+ domain class has a reference to +CrmContact+ that represents the attender. This is the main reason why this
plugin have a compile-time dependency on the +crm-contact+ plugin.

== CrmTaskService

+CrmTaskService+ provides lots of useful methods for task management.

=== Create a task

To create a new task you use +crmTaskService.createTask(Map values, boolean save)+. Mandatory properties in +CrmTask+ are +name+, +type+, +startTime+ and +endTime+.
Name is the title of the task and is displayed in lists and reports. Type specifies the task type and must exist prior to creating a task.
Start time and end time can be set in a few different ways, the most common way is to set them both to +Date+ instances.
Another option is to set +startTime+ to a +Date+ instance and +duration+ in (int) minutes.
Setting the transient property +duration+ will set +endTime+ automatically.

[source,groovy]
.CreateSimpleTask.groovy
----
def type = crmTaskService.createTaskType(name: "Phone call", true)
def task = crmTaskService.createTask(number: 42, name: "Call Sam and schedule meeting", type: type, startTime: new Date() + 1, duration: 30, true)
----

=== Search for tasks

As usual in {gr8crm} plugins the main service has a +list()+ method that performs a query.

TIP: The +list()+ method is +@Selectable+ which means you can use the +selection+ plugin to query for tasks.

+def list(Map query, Map params)+

To search for tasks you initialize the +query+ map with query values. With the +params+ map you can specify things like
sort order and pagination. The following query keys can be used in the +query+ map.

[options="header"]
|===
| Key           | Description         | Type
| number        | Task number         | String (wildcard supported)
| name          | Task name/title     | String (wildcard supported)
| location      | Task location       | String (wildcard supported)
| type          | Task type           | String (wildcard supported)
| username      | Task owner/user     | String
| priority      | Task priority       | Integer (0, 20, 40, 60, 80, 100)
| complete      | Task completion %   | Integer (0-100)
| fromDate      | Task start/end time | Date or String (yyyy-MM-dd)
| toDate        | Task start/end time | Date or String (yyyy-MM-dd)
| reference     | Task reference      | Domain instance or *reference identifier*
| referenceType | Type of reference   | Domain class (property) name
|===

The following example will find all tasks that refer to contacts (crmContact), starts or ends during July 2014
and are not started. As you can see you can combine several query values when you search for domain instances.

[source,groovy]
.FindSummerTasks.groovy
----
def result = crmTaskService.list([referenceType: 'crmContact',
    fromDate: '2014-07-01', toDate: '2014-07-31', complete: 0], [:])
----

=== Setting task status

A task keep track if it's completed or not. The +completed+ property is an +int+ constrained to 0-100 which represents
how many percent completed the task is. The +CrmTask+ domain class has three constants that defines common/simple states of completion.
These constants can be used when you don't need fine grained control of how many percent is complete.

|===
| CrmTask.STATUS_PLANNED   |   0 | The task is not started (it's zero percent complete)
| CrmTask.STATUS_ACTIVE    |  50 | The task is started but not yet completed (it's 50 % complete)
| CrmTask.STATUS_COMPLETED | 100 | The task is completed (it's 100 % complete)
|===

To set status for a task you use one of the three setStatusXxxx() methods in CrmTaskService.

[source,groovy]
.SetTaskStatus.groovy
----
def task = crmTaskService.createTask(name: "Fix BUG-1234", type: bug, startTime: new Date(), duration: 60, true)

crmTaskService.setStatusPlanned(task)   // Planned (0 %) is the default so this call does nothing
crmTaskService.setStatusActive(task)    // Do some work
crmTaskService.setStatusCompleted(task) // We are finished!
----

To check if a task is completed you can call +isCompleted()+ on the +CrmTask+ instance.

=== Task duration

The time between a task's +startTime+ and +endTime+ is the task's duration.
The transient property +duration+ returns the task's duration as a +groovy.time.Duration+ instance.
You can also set the duration property to a +groovy.time.Duration+ instance or minutes as an +Integer+.
One of +startTime+ or +endTime+ must be set before you can set the duration property, this is because
setDuration() simply calculates and sets +startTime+ or +endTime+ for you.

If you want to calculate the total duration for a set of tasks you can call +crmTaskService.getTotalDuration(Collection<CrmTask>)+.
It will return a +groovy.time.Duration+ instance that is the sum of all task durations.

[source,groovy]
.MyTimeSheet.groovy
----
def tasks = crmTaskService.list([username: 'me', reference: theProject], [:])
def duration = crmTaskService.getTotalDuration(tasks)
println "I spent $duration on the project"
----

== Alarms

You can set an alarm for a task. A *quartz* job +CrmTaskAlarmJob+ will monitor alarms and trigger an application event when the time is up.
To do something useful (like sending an email or text message) when the alarm is triggered you must add an event listener in your application
that listens for the +crmTask.alarm+ event and take appropriate action.

To set an alarm for a task you just have to set two properties on the task instance. Set +alarmTime+ to a +Date+ instance and +alarmType+ to an +Integer+.
The +CrmTask+ domain class defines +Integer+ constants for common alarm types.

[options="header"]
|===
| Constant                   | Value | Description
| CrmTask.ALARM_NONE         |  0    | No alarm will be triggered
| CrmTask.ALARM_EMAIL        |  1    | Send an email to the user that owns the task
| CrmTask.ALARM_SMS          |  2    | Send a text message to the user that owns the task
| CrmTask.ALARM_RESERVED_1   |  3    | Reserved for future use
| CrmTask.ALARM_RESERVED_2   |  4    | Reserved for future use
| CrmTask.ALARM_RESERVED_3   |  5    | Reserved for future use
| CrmTask.ALARM_CUSTOM_1     | 10    | Application defined alarm type
| CrmTask.ALARM_CUSTOM_2     | 11    | Application defined alarm type
| CrmTask.ALARM_CUSTOM_3     | 12    | Application defined alarm type
